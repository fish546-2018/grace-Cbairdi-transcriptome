# Effects of temperature and _Hematodinium sp._ - infection (Bitter Crab Syndrome) on Southeast Alaskan Tanner Crabs (_Chionoecetes bairdi_)

# The problem
Southeast Alaskan Tanner crabs support a $21 million fishery. However, warming temperatures and disease threaten stock numbers and marketability. The prevalence of Bitter Crab Disease caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate _Hematodinium sp._ ranges from 0-100% in SE Alaskan populations, and is projected to increase with increasing temperatures. The disease itself may not be directly fatal to the crabs, but it causes their meat to become chalky in texture and bitter in taste, rendering them unmarketable and negatively impacting the livelihoods of many. 

With temperatures projected to increase, it is thought that the increase in temperature will physiologically stress these naturally cold-water crabs, and also increase the prevalence of Bitter Crab Disease. 



## Goals
This project aims to use bioinformatic tools to identify genes of SE Alaskan Tanner crabs (_Chionoecetes bairdi_) that are involved in immunity and temperature stress response.  

# Data and analysis
RNA sequence data from a pooled _C. bairdi_ hemolymph sample was received from the Northwest Genomics Centeer (NWGC) at the University of Washington. The data came in the form of .fastq files with sequence reads for both the forward and reverse transcripts of the pooled sample.

The sequence reads were assmebled into a transcriptome using Trinity. The assembled transcriptome was compared to uniprot/swissprot (database of known proteins) and a nucleotide database with taxonomy information using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). The BLAST output from the comparison with the protein database was annotated using GO (gene ontology) terms, which tells us what genes are present, and what their functions are. The BLAST output from the nucleotide taxonomy database was used to identify what was in the sample, and we found that _Hematodinium_ genetic material was present.

This pie chart was made in [excel](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/Blastquery-GOslim-sep.xlsx) based on the number of proteins counted for each GOslim category with this file: [Blastquery-GOslim-sep.csv](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/analyses/Blastquery-GOslim-sep.csv), which is the output file with columns tab delimited [using R](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/scripts/plots.R) from this python notebook: [11052018-C_bairdi-blastn.ipynb](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/notebooks/11052018-C_bairdi-blastn.ipynb).

This pie chart was made using the [output](http://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/bu-mox/analyses/1114b/cg-trinity-nt.tab) from the BLAST of the assembled crab transcriptome with a ```nt``` database that includes taxonomy data. The "crab-related" proportion was found by using ```grep("crab", tax$common_name)``` in the column with the animal common names. The "Hematodinium sp." proportion was found in the same way. The "other" category lumps all the other taxonomy groups, since we are interested in the composition of _Hematodinium sp._ and crab-related proteins. (Made using this script: [taxa_breakdown.R](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/scripts/taxa_breakdown.R)).
