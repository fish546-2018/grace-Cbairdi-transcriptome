# Effects of temperature and _Hematodinium sp._ - infection (Bitter Crab Disease) on Southeast Alaskan Tanner Crabs (_Chionoecetes bairdi_)
This project aims to use bioinformatic tools to identify genes of SE Alaskan Tanner crabs (_Chionoecetes bairdi_) that are involved in immunity and temperature stress response. 

## Repository structure and Contents
[analyses](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/tree/master/analyses)
- output files from R, FastQC

[data](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/tree/master/data)
- .fastq files from the _C. bairdi_ pooled RNA sample that was library-prepped and sequenced at the NWGC. 

[notebooks](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/tree/master/notebooks)
- Jupyter notebooks used for analyses

[scripts](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/tree/master/scripts)
- R scripts used for analyses, and .sh scripts for running jobs on Mox

## Project Timeline (FISH 546 Fall Quarter 2018)
- Week 4: FastQC files and assemble using Trinity on Mox; set up script for running BLAST once assembly is complete
- Week 5: Run BLAST, and classify according to biological function using GO terms and GO Slim terms
