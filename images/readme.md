- contains images from the final sampling day (D 26) in Juneau, AK

### [F546-flowchart.png](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/images/F546-flowchart.png)
- Flow chart depicting the methods used to assemble, annotate, and analyze the _C. bairdi_ transcriptome

### [GOslim-pie-lib01.png](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/images/GOslim-pie-lib01.png)
- pie chart made using [excel](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/analyses/Blastquery-GOslim-sep.xlsx) showing the relative proportions of GO terms of interest that were expressed in the pooled _C. bairdi_ pooled samples

### [taxa-proportions.png](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/images/taxa-proportions.png)
- pie chart made using [taxa_breakdown.R](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/scripts/taxa_breakdown.R) to compare the proportion of taxonomic groups that are crab-related and the taxonomic groups that are from the genus _Hematodinium_ with everything else lumped into "other"

### [taxa-wordcloud.png](https://github.com/fish546-2018/grace-Cbairdi-transcriptome/blob/master/images/taxa-wordcloud.png)
- Word cloud made (by Steven) using the output from the BLAST with the ```nt``` taxonomy database, showing that _Hematodinium_ and _Chionoecetes_ were present in the pooled sample
