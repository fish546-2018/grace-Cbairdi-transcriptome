```data``` contents:


The following files are all from _C. bairdi_ [library 1](https://grace-ac.github.io/Pooled-sample-handed-toNWGC/), which is a pool of 15 samples from Day 26: ambient infected; ambient uninfected, cold infected; cold uninfected. Will be used for gene discovery. They were not fully downloaded, and thus are severely shortened versions of the files, but were used for practice.
